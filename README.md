Factory Safety Law AI & Compliance Platform
By Safety Station School (safety.ac.th)
Project Overview
This open-source initiative is dedicated to simplifying and automating factory safety law compliance for safety professionals and industrial organizations. Developed by Safety Station School (Thailand), our goal is to bridge the gap between complex legal requirements and daily operational safety.

In Thailand and many regions, safety regulations for factories (such as fire safety, confined spaces, and machinery handling) are extensive and difficult to navigate. This platform utilizes AI to provide instant, accurate legal interpretations and safety management tools.

Key Modules
Legal Knowledge Base: A comprehensive, AI-indexed database of factory safety laws and ministerial regulations.

AI Compliance Assistant: A specialized agent that answers complex questions regarding safety standards based on verified legal data.

JSA & Risk Assessment Generator: Tools to help Safety Officers (จป.วิชาชีพ) create Job Safety Analysis (JSA) reports based on legal requirements.

Safety Training Planner: Automated curriculum design for mandatory safety training sessions.

Why We Need Claude Max
To ensure the highest level of safety, the AI must process dense legal documents with extreme precision. Claude's advanced reasoning is essential for:

High-Fidelity Legal Analysis: Interpreting subtle nuances in safety legislation to prevent compliance errors.

Multilingual Accuracy: Providing reliable safety guidance in both Thai and English for international industrial standards.

Complex Reasoning: Assisting safety supervisors in making critical decisions during risk assessments.

Technical Implementation
Frontend: Next.js (Open SaaS Architecture).

Database & ORM: PostgreSQL with Prisma.

AI Integration: Anthropic Claude API for RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation).
